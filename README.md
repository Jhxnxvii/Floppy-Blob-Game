<h3>
  In this project, I tried my hand at creating a game inspired by the popular Flappy Bird. It was my first attempt at game development using C#. Inside the repository, you'll find all the basic elements needed to build "Floppy Blob." The included GIF preview gives you a sneak peek of what the game looks like. Come take a look and explore my journey as a beginner in game development.
